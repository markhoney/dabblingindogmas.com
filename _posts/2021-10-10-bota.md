The Dabblers attend a BOTA service and discuss their response to an eclectic Californian mixture of tarot, kabbalah, alchemy, Jungian archetypes, and more.

We chanted through an opening ceremony, engaged in musically-accompanied silent meditation, and heard a sermon that linked the colour grey to the philosopher's stone. The podcast considers the origins this eclectic Californian mixture of tarot, kabbalah, alchemy, and other spiritual influences, and reveals our personal reactions to the service. We also decide whether we enjoyed the experience!
