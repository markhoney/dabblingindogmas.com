The Dabblers go shopping at a Halloween witches market, and we pay for a Tarot card reading.

We browsed stalls selling wands, potions, taxidermied animals, herbs, candles and other paraphernalia. In the podcast we talk about meeting the Satanists, and we talk about the official Wizard of New Zealand. We also convinced Alexander to have a Tarot card reading, and we have fun dissecting the experience.
