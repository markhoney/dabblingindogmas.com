The Dabblers attend a Sikh temple in Wellington for a service including Bhog Sri Akhand Path, Kirtan and Ardaas.

For our second visit to the Sikh temple, we resolved to stay for the entire service. As with last time, we were warmly welcomed and looked after during our visit. At the end of the event we were given a takeaway box of food from the langar.
