The Dabblers learn how to cast the I Ching via Zoom, and consider whether ancient Chinese divination has light to shed on modern concerns.

We attended a Zoom seminar on the I Ching. We were first given some guidance about how to formulate questions for the I Ching to answer, and taught to cast using the three-coin method. The podcast considers the long history of Chinese divination, reveals what we thought of the technique we were taught, and ponders its relevance to the questions we posed during our training session. We also decide whether we enjoyed the experience!
