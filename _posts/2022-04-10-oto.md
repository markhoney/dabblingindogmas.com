In this episode the dabblers spend an evening trying out meditation with the OTO. They give guided meditation a try, as well as singing in the round, meditating in silence and imagining themselves as the centre of the universe. Mark and Tim also talk about their previous experiences at the OTO's Gnostic Mass.
