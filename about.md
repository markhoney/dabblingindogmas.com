## About our Podcast

Back in 2012, Tim and Mark met through their local [Skeptics in the Pub meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Skeptics-in-the-Pub) and quickly found they had a shared fascination of all things spiritual, esoteric and comspiratorial. Both had been visiting local churches and meetings, quietly observing how these groups operated. Together, they organised visits to many weird and wonderful events, such as:

- Scientology Meetings
- OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis) Gnostic Mass
- BOTA (Builders of the Adytum) Services
- A Mormon Church (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Service
- Jehovah's Witness Convention and a Memorial Service
- A David Icke all day Lecture
- Creationist Talks
- Faith Healings
- A Sikh Gurdwara
- A 9/11 Conspiracy Display
- A Messianic Jewish Service
- An I Ching Lesson
- Spiritualist Church Services
- Many Evangelical Christian Services

Recently, Tim and Mark have managed to convince fellow Skeptics in the Pub members Bronwyn and Alexander to join them on their adventures, and the four of them decided to start a podcast chronicling their visits.
