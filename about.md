## Why does this Podcast exist?

Back in 2012, [Tim](#tim) and [Mark](#mark) met through their local [Skeptics in the Pub meeting](https://www.meetup.com/Wellington-Skeptics-in-the-Pub) and quickly found they had a shared fascination of all things spiritual, esoteric and conspiratorial. Both had been visiting local churches and meetings, quietly observing how these groups operated. Together, they organised visits to many weird and wonderful events, such as:

- Scientology Meetings
- An OTO (Ordo Templi Orientis) Gnostic Mass
- BOTA (Builders of the Adytum) Services
- A Mormon Church (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) Service
- Jehovah's Witness Convention and a Memorial Service
- A David Icke full day Lecture
- Creationist Talks
- Faith Healings
- A Sikh Gurdwara
- A 9/11 Conspiracy Exhibit
- A Messianic Jewish Service
- An I Ching Lesson
- Spiritualist Church Services
- A Greek Orthodox Service
- Many, many Evangelical Christian Services

Recently, Tim and Mark have managed to convince fellow Skeptics in the Pub members [Bronwyn](#bronwyn) and [Alexander](#alexander) to join them on their adventures, and the four of them decided to start a podcast chronicling their visits. Expect to hear about return visits to all of the above, along with lots of new stuff we've never done before (as a taster, we're hoping to meet with Hindus, Muslims, Pagans and more in the coming months).
