Dabbling in Dogmas is a podcast in which a group of like-minded skeptics investigate the belief communities we find around us. We sometimes find the things we see funny, but we don't do this to poke fun - we are motivated by a genuine curiosity about people and their belief systems. While visiting we try to sit attentively in the back and observe; we stand up when everybody else stands up, sit down when everybody else sits down, and attempt to chant along when everybody else is chanting.

As we say at the start of each podcast episode, _"We’re not on a spiritual journey, we’re journeying among the spiritual"_. If you would like to vicariously participate in our adventures, join us as we enjoy the diversity of the human experience.
